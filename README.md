## Possible improvements
- **Global**
  - improve the tree-shaking process:
    - use @mdi/js for Material Desing Icons in order to reduce redundant bundle size
    - remove usages of Vuetify's utility classes or clean them up using libraries like PurgeCSS
    - manually import Vuetify's components instead of using their global versions
  - add 404 and 500 error pages
  - add head metatags, a dynamic title and a description 
- **Main page**
  - fix the skeleton size in order to prevent layout shifts after the data finishes loading
  - make the header and the filter more compact, add a virtual scrolling block to the Pokemons' list
  - implement lazy load for the favourite Pokemons list
- **Details page**
  - create a loader skeleton for the page instead of the layout circular loader
